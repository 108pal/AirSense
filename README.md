Air Quality Index Tracker :detects quality of air of the desired location.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numerical scale used to measure and report the quality of outdoor air in a specific location. 
It provides information about the level of air pollution and its potential impacts on human health.

Why use AirSense?
An Air Quality Index (AQI) tracker is used to monitor and assess the quality of the air in a specific area or region. It provides a numerical value or a color-coded scale that indicates the level of air pollution and its potential impact on human health. Here are a few reasons why an AQI tracker is used:

1.Health and Safety: The primary purpose of an AQI tracker is to inform the public about the quality of the air they are breathing. By providing a simple and understandable index, people can quickly determine if the air quality is safe or if there are potential health risks. It helps individuals, especially those with respiratory conditions or allergies, make informed decisions about outdoor activities and take necessary precautions to protect their health.

2.Environmental Monitoring: AQI trackers are essential tools for monitoring the environment and tracking changes in air quality over time. They collect data on various air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). By analyzing this data, scientists and policymakers can identify pollution sources, assess the effectiveness of pollution control measures, and develop strategies to improve air quality.

3.Public Awareness and Education: AQI trackers raise awareness about the impact of air pollution on human health and the environment. By providing easily accessible information, they help educate the public about the causes and consequences of poor air quality. This knowledge empowers individuals and communities to take action to reduce pollution, support clean air initiatives, and advocate for policies that prioritize air quality improvement.

4.Regulatory Compliance: Many countries and regions have established air quality standards and regulations to protect public health and the environment. AQI trackers play a crucial role in monitoring compliance with these standards. They provide real-time data that can be used by environmental agencies and local authorities to assess pollution levels, identify areas of concern, and enforce necessary measures to achieve and maintain compliance.

5.Urban Planning and Decision-Making: AQI trackers contribute to urban planning and decision-making processes. By tracking air quality patterns, authorities can identify areas with persistent air pollution problems and prioritize interventions. This information is valuable for developing sustainable transportation systems, implementing emission control strategies, and designing cities with better air quality in mind.
